What classes are needed?

Classes:
    - Organism -> base class
        > functions
            + move()
            + breed()
    - Ant -> derived class
    - Doodlebug -> derived class
        > functions
            + starve()


    - Cell Class
        > Attributes
            + Bool occupied?
            + organism type

main Function:
    - Needs to create a 2D array with columns and rows
        > This array will be type Cell which itself holds organism objects;

Things to remember:
    - Movement and actions are kept by a variable time
    - Need to create an array 20x20 that holds objects of ant or doodlebug
    - Need a random function to determine movement
